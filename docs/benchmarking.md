# FluxFast Benchmarking & Performance Methodology

## Signature Scenario: Cross-Page Resource Reuse

In traditional server-driven architectures, transitioning from `/dashboard` to `/rooms` resends all shared page props (`auth`, `hotel`, `permissions`, `settings`) on every navigation.

FluxFast eliminates this redundancy:

```text
/dashboard (6 resources)
    ↓  [client sends X-FluxFast-Known header]
/rooms (4 shared + 2 new)
    ↓
Delta Response: only `room_types` and `rooms` transferred!
```

The controlled fixture uses the same FastAPI process and synthetic dataset for a
complete-props endpoint and the FluxFast routes. Run it on the target machine:

```bash
pnpm benchmark
```

The command runs both controlled scenarios. The cross-page script reports
observed duration and bytes for the initial dashboard, complete rooms props,
and the resource delta. It also asserts that the four shared values are absent
and their loaders executed only once.

## Deferred Resource Scenario

The deferred benchmark uses three uncacheable async resources with fixed loader
delays: `fast=10 ms`, `medium=100 ms`, and `slow=500 ms`. Every sample measures:

- a legacy blocking request with all three immediate resources;
- a capability-enabled blocking request, which controls for overhead on
  ordinary `defer=False` resources;
- a deferred initial request that resolves only `fast`; and
- one resource-only follow-up that resolves `medium` and `slow` concurrently.

It reports response latency, payload bytes, resources returned, pending keys,
cache hits/misses, and loader counts. Correctness checks require the deferred
initial response to run only the fast loader, the follow-up to run the two slow
loaders, and both blocking requests to keep every resource immediate. CI uses
those relative sequencing checks and does not enforce machine-dependent timing
thresholds.

### Observed Reference Run

On 2026-08-30, three samples on Linux WSL2 x86_64 with Python 3.13.14 produced:

| Measurement | Median latency | Payload | Resources | Pending |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Blocking baseline initial | 504.00 ms | 1,335 B | 3 | 0 |
| Blocking capable initial | 503.93 ms | 1,375 B | 3 | 0 |
| Deferred initial | 12.93 ms | 542 B | 1 | 2 |
| Deferred follow-up | 503.67 ms | 1,011 B | 2 | 0 |
| Deferred settlement (two requests) | 516.63 ms | 1,553 B total | 3 | 0 |

The observed capability-only blocking delta was -0.07 ms, which is measurement
noise rather than a universal performance claim. Deferral made the initial
envelope available before the 100/500 ms loaders ran, while total settlement
was 12.63 ms slower and transferred 218 additional bytes because it used two
protocol envelopes. All cache-hit counters were zero by design, loader counts
matched the expected sequence, and the benchmark's correctness checks passed.

Wall-clock results vary by machine. Run `pnpm benchmark` on the target system
and use its output instead of treating this reference run as a guarantee.
Browser rendering, retry, navigation-race, and mutation behavior are covered by
the separate Playwright integration suite.
